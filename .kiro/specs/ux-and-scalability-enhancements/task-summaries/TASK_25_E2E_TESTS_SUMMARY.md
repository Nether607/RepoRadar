## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:run -- tests/CriticalPaths.e2e.test.ts

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:run -- tests/CriticalPaths.e2e.test.ts -t "Repository Analysis"
```

## Test Dependencies

- **vitest**: Test runner
- **@testing-library/react**: Component testing
- **@testing-library/user-event**: User interaction simulation
- **supertest**: HTTP assertion library
- **express**: Mock server setup

## Notes

### Current Status
- Test structure is complete and comprehensive
- 25 unit/integration tests pass successfully
- 43 API tests require actual server implementation to pass
- Tests demonstrate proper structure and coverage

### Next Steps for Full Integration
1. Implement actual API routes in Express app
2. Set up test database and Redis instances
3. Configure authentication middleware
4. Implement job queue processors
5. Add health check endpoints

### Test Patterns Used
- **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
- **Mock-based testing**: For external dependencies
- **Integration testing**: For component interactions
- **End-to-end testing**: For complete user flows
