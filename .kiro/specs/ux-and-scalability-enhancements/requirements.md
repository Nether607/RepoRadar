# Requirements Document - UX and Scalability Enhancements

## Introduction

This feature focuses on enhancing the user experience and preparing RepoRadar for production scale. Following the successful completion of Phase 2 (Performance Optimization), Phase 3 addresses user-facing improvements, code quality, operational monitoring, and horizontal scaling capabilities. The goal is to transform RepoRadar from a performant application into a polished, production-ready platform with enterprise-grade user experience and scalability.

This phase is divided into two main focus areas:
- **Week 1:** User experience improvements and code quality cleanup
- **Week 2:** Analytics, monitoring, and scalability preparation
