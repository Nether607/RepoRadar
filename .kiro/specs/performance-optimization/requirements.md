# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive performance optimization for RepoRadar across three critical areas: database operations, API performance, and frontend delivery. The goal is to significantly improve application responsiveness, reduce server load, and enhance user experience through systematic performance improvements including database indexing, connection pooling, response caching, compression, GitHub API optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, and bundle optimization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a RepoRadar user, I want database operations to be fast and efficient, so that I can get analysis results quickly without experiencing delays or timeouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application performs database queries THEN the system SHALL use appropriate indexes to minimize query execution time
2. WHEN multiple database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling to efficiently manage database resources
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL monitor and log query performance metrics
4. WHEN slow queries are detected THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings with query details
5. IF a query takes longer than 1000ms THEN the system SHALL log it as a slow query with execution plan details
6. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL verify all required database indexes exist and create missing ones

### Requirement 2: API Response Performance

**User Story:** As a RepoRadar user, I want API responses to be fast and bandwidth-efficient, so that the application feels responsive and works well on slower connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses contain cacheable data THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching headers and mechanisms
2. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL compress responses using gzip or brotli compression
3. WHEN making requests to GitHub API THEN the system SHALL optimize API usage through batching, caching, and rate limit management
4. WHEN returning large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to limit response size
5. IF cached data is available and valid THEN the system SHALL return cached responses instead of regenerating data
6. WHEN API responses are cached THEN the system SHALL implement cache invalidation strategies for data freshness

### Requirement 3: Frontend Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a RepoRadar user, I want the frontend to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can start using the application without long wait times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use code splitting to load only necessary JavaScript bundles
2. WHEN components are not immediately visible THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading to defer component loading
3. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size through tree shaking and minification
4. WHEN users navigate between routes THEN the system SHALL preload critical route components
5. IF a component is below the fold THEN the system SHALL lazy load it when it comes into viewport
6. WHEN static assets are served THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate caching headers for browser caching

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining RepoRadar, I want comprehensive performance monitoring, so that I can identify bottlenecks and track improvement effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are active THEN the system SHALL collect and expose performance metrics
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL track query execution times and connection pool usage
3. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL monitor response times and cache hit rates
4. WHEN frontend assets load THEN the system SHALL track bundle sizes and load times
5. IF performance metrics exceed defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate alerts or warnings
6. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints or dashboards for monitoring

### Requirement 5: Graceful Performance Degradation

**User Story:** As a RepoRadar user, I want the application to remain functional even when performance optimizations fail, so that I can continue using the system reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching systems fail THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct data retrieval without crashing
2. WHEN database connection pooling encounters issues THEN the system SHALL fall back to direct connections
3. WHEN compression fails THEN the system SHALL serve uncompressed responses
4. WHEN lazy loading fails THEN the system SHALL load components immediately as fallback
5. IF performance monitoring systems fail THEN the system SHALL continue normal operation without monitoring
6. WHEN any performance optimization fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with degraded performance
